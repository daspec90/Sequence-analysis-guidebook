##DNA sequence analysis pipeline:
* Download using Globus
* gunzip files
* make alias:  `ln -s long_file_name.fastq shorter_name.fastq`
* count lines in file: `wc -l shorter_name.fastq`
* calculate the % of one mismatch barcodes in each file

N.B. the number of lines divided by four was equal to the reported total number of reads for all downloaded files. For Chr16, it was ~4%; all others it was ~3%

###Fastqc
* subset a smaller set of sequence data for fastqc analysis: `awk 'NR >250000 {exit} NR >=1 && NR <=250000' shorter_name.fastq > small.fastq`
* to determine the size of an individual file type: `du -h filename`

Note that the maximum attachment size for Gmail is 25 Mb. These file sizes are ~21 Mb.



## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
